<h1 id="about-the-project"> 📓 About The Project </h1>

`Breast Cancer Prediction` is the multivariable logistic regression model, which predicts if the breast cancer is malignant or
benign based on the measurements of the breast cell nuclei such as area, concavity and texture.
Firstly, the dataset is divided into two sets: training and test datasets. The given dataset is analyzed and the columns 
with the greatest potential for improvement of the model are selected as the features. Then, the model is built and trained
on the dataset. The accuracy of the trained model is 94.51%.

The project was built to learn the basics of logistic regression and cosolidate the knowledge acquired during Google Machine Learning Crash Course.
